# Capricheese

First of all, this is a project that was done as a group in the last year of high school, so I want to shout-out my friends: Ezequiel Arguello, Henry Capdevila, Alexander Pajuelo and Lautaro Perez. And also a big hug to my teachers and mentors of that year: Federico Fotti, Jorge Torres, Hector Prado and Analia Aprá. if any of you read this, Thanks for everything.

This program was made for a competition, the "National Programming Olympic" organized by the INET (Institución Nacional de Educación Tecnica) of Argentina. There is also documentation of the project and a lot of information on how it was done in the following Google Drive folder: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SliRnUpo0DAXLrfsk9Jl3ftoSf1IhSp8?usp=sharing (please note that all documentation is entirely in Spanish).
